The [Association of Virtual Assistants](https://associationofvas.com/){:target="_blank"} (AVA) was created by and for VAs at each and every stage of their career. Knowing the life cycle of a virtual assistant means more clarity, provides you with more options and opportunities, as well as helps you paint the vision for any future you wish to create. You can move through each stage as you choose and we’ll be here to support and celebrate your accomplishments!

Whether you are just starting out, looking to make your next change or haven’t officially launched your business it’s important to know the seven stages.

1. Determining if being a VA is right for you
2. Starting your VA business
3. How to get clients as a virtual assistant
4. Diversifying your income
5. How to grow your VA business
6. Rebranding yourself completely
7. Retiring Your Business

The most important thing to know is these do not have to happen in order and often don’t!

As much as we love our processes and steps being a business owner is not a linear process. It stretches us and grows us both personally and professionally. Opportunities don’t always come when we are in a “perfect” place in life. We take chances and calculated risks. All these things, plus our daily lives can have us bouncing around and back and forth often. What you need to know is that it’s okay!

This is why being part of the [Association of Virtual Assistants](https://associationofvas.com/){:target="_blank"} is so important. Our mission is to be the most trusted source of information in the VA industry. We promote a high standard of excellence within our Association which not only benefits current and future virtual assistants, but those we serve - the client.

Being part of the AVA means you can trust there is a shared common purpose with your fellow members that believe in the mutual enrichment and advancement of their career as well. You’re not in competition at any stage of your career. You are in unity. We are all better together.

When you join the AVA you not only receive the support, guidance, education, and advocacy you deserve throughout the life cycle of a virtual assistant, you get to pay it forward. Not just for the VA joining tomorrow but for the next generation. It will be your shoulders and foundation they get to stand on.

The Association of Virtual Assistants is here for you today, tomorrow, and at every stage of your career. [Join](https://thevirtualbusinesssummit.thrivecart.com/ava-membership/){:target="_blank"} the AVA now to get your support.
