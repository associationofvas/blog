In the last article we discussed the need for diversifying your incomes streams. In the upcoming articles we’ll discuss different opportunities for you to explore. The best part is you don’t have to leave the VA industry or change your title. In fact, keeping it helps you!

Whenever you start over in a new industry you can bring all your years of experience. However, many of your clients will want ___relevant___ years of experience. You need to prove relevant experience and then be prepared to match that up with the competition. Not always the best place to be.

Now, when you take your current and relevant experience and add to your virtual assistant title it all makes sense. It’s the natural progression of any field to rise through the ranks and take the lead. It’s a classic leadership model. Rarely does anyone ever start as the CEO or VP. The person takes their years of relevant experience adds in personal and professional development and then rises to those roles.

What does this look like as a VA? Well you could become a coach, consultant, trainer, mastermind facilitator, etc. However, instead of dropping the title of virtual assistant you get really specific on who your market is. Are you the coach for VAs just starting out or growing their teams? Do you consult VAs on software implementation and streamlining their business? Do you train VAs on product launches and how to manage them successfully? Is your sweet spot in facilitation and masterminds are where you deliver the most value?

These are just a few ideas. The power here is actually using your relevant experience, keeping your trusted title - how people know you - then making a progression that naturally seems like the next step is business for you.

To keep it simple, write down what you are earning right now and then add an additional $100 a week to it. Now multiply that by four. Now multiply that by twelve. Do you see the power of diversifying your income streams? Having just one more way to bring in money makes a huge difference!
