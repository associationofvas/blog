Rebranding is something VAs love to do! However, most don’t consider the consequences. Rebranding can be done at any time during your career and in business. It doesn’t just happen when you change your title or offer a new service. Before you rebrand you should know what you are doing.

__Rebranding is a marketing strategy in which a new name, term, symbol, design, or combination is created for an _established_ brand with the intention of developing a new, _differentiated identity_ in the minds of consumers, investors, competitors, and other stakeholders.__

Big businesses actually don’t like to rebrand. Some don’t and it is to their detriment. They know how costly it can be, how it can affect their current users and/or client, and how much work it is to gain the trust and loyalty of a new user/client instead of building upon the relationship they currently have.

More often than not we hear about companies who try to rebrand only to have fallen very short and at the cost of losing the company millions of dollars or going out of business altogether. Weight Watchers was one of the latest companies to rebrand so poorly their stock fell 35%! The fact is, most companies don’t need to rebrand if they stay current. Every business needs to be current which requires updates not rebranding.

If you are established and purposely want to have your clients and customers think about you differently then rebranding is for you. In this next blog series, here are some instances where you might wish to rebrand:
