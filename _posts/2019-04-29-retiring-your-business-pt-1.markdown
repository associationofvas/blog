Retiring your business doesn’t necessarily mean you have to be retiring. You could be moving onto bigger and better things or this could be part of a sale or being acquired. In these times, even if your business reputation for the future isn’t a priority your planning efforts should be.

There are several things to keep in mind. These are also good practices to take even before you are ready to retire your business.

1. Develop an exit plan.
2. Create a personal financial plan.
3. Formalize a succession plan.

This may all seem overwhelming to do at once. And it would be if you tried to do it on your own. While there will be work for you to do. This is definitely not a time to go at it alone. You’ll want to hire trusted professionals, but you will have to do your homework first.

In the upcoming blogs we’ll be walking you through the homework steps.
