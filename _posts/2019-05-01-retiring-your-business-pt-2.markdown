Think it’s too soon to begin developing an exit plan? It’s not too soon. However, it could be too late by the time you start thinking about retiring your business.

Before you seek the advice of a trusted Certified Exit Planner go in knowing what questions should be asked and answered.

There are many reasons for exiting - retirement, health problems, change of interest, selling the business, or being acquired. Knowing the right time to exit is crucial. Something you’ll only know when it’s been written out and formalized in a plan.

If you are just starting out or at the top of your game exiting may seem like an unnecessary step. However, knowing the end goals will help you make better decisions now and for the future of your business.
