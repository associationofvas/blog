Founder of Weisz Collaborative, I am a Full-Time Content Creator, who is skillful in research, editing, and social media platforms. I help entrepreneurs offload essential tasks that take up their valuable time in their business, so they can get back to being creative and put their focus where it matters.

Why I recommend AVA:  AVA provides a wealth of knowledge that has been vetted and you can trust. Along with that, the community support of others on similar journeys is a wonderful asset.

Fun Facts About Me: I owned a bakery for two years but never went to culinary school. I am a sucker for a Hallmark movie anytime of year. I am always planning my next trip!
