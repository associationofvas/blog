Why I recommend AVA: They offer such value to VAs at all levels - value in resources and value in support

Fun Facts About Me: I sang at Carnegie Hall in NYC as a kid, I can hold conversation easily with strangers and love public speaking (or speaking at online functions) but I am actually extremely shy (that's odd, right?!)
