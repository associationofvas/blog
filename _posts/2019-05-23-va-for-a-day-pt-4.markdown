I help coaches and leaders launch and run podcasts, and manage the operations side of their businesses.  I achieved my MBA and have over 20 years of office experience followed by 5 years in the digital marketing arena.   I am a member of the Association of Virtual Assistants, Next Big Idea Book Club, altPodcaster, and the National Association of Women MBA's (NAWMBA).

Why I would recommend AVA: It is made up of some of the most talented and dynamic VA leaders in the industry and they are constantly working to help every member truly succeed.

Fun Facts About Me: I have a strong love of unicorns that began before they were mainstream. If you are ever on a call with me, if you look closely, you will most likely see a unicorn somewhere.
My family and I spend a lot of time camping, it's a favorite activity for all of us.
I am an empath and have a strong love for people, plants, and animals.
