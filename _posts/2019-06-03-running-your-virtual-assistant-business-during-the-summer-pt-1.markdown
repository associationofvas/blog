With over a decade of handling back-office administrative tasks, I am a highly motivated professional freelance virtual assistant with experience working with legal firms, insurance agencies, real estate agencies, healthcare offices and affiliate marketers.  My name is Jennifer Baker - the owner of Hively VA.

I specialize in working for Entrepreneurs and Small Business Owners. I have knowledge and expertise in working with various tech platforms handling functions such as: email management, calendar management, database management, bookkeeping, social media management, real estate transaction coordination, client communications, implementing functional workflows and creative marketing plans.

With a forward-thinking mindset, I am highly organized, detailed, structured, and have a passion for the success of the people I work with.

__Why I recommend AVA:__
I would recommend any virtual assistant to have an association or group that can provide support and offer guidance.  I feel that it is imperative to future successes to have other like-minded individuals to call upon or gain further insight from.  The virtual world can be enlightening and fascinating, but it also can be overwhelming.  Having this group is like having a safety net that guides you through bumpy roads and keeps pushing you forward toward your goals!

__My fun facts:__
* I own 4 dogs (2 chessies, a bulldog and a yorkie) that keep me company 24/7: Roxy, Buoy, Mack & Beanie
* I love to travel to specifically visit beaches!  They are so invigorating and renewing to my spirit!
* I compete in Tough Mudder annually!  Being physically active is a passion of mine!
