Virtea helps entrepreneurs with "everything else". Whatever the problem is that is keeping you from being able to focus on your core business, I will take care of it for you. Either by doing it myself, or by finding you the best solution.

__Connect With Me:__
* LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/asa-vea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asa-vea){:target="_blank"}

__Why I recommend AVA:__
Networking with peers is the best way to learn more about the profession, and to find inspiration and help when you need it.

__My fun facts:__
* When I was a child, I met author Astrid Lindgren. The creator Pippi Longstocking. That is still the famous person that I am the most happy to have met.  
* I love music, but I'm not very fond of concerts. Partly because I love mixing my music. My favorites range from Ella Fitzgerald to Metallica. Hard to fit into one concert...
