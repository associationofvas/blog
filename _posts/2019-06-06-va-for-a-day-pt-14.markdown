As a Virtual Assistant and Business Manager, I am here to take on the behind-the-scenes efforts of what it takes to manage an online business. Let me handle those things that make you look like the expert you are.

__Why I recommend AVA:__
The AVA is a great resource for new and established VAs. It provides community for those in the industry who don't fit other online service provider niches. Being a VA comes with a specialized business model and set of standards. To have a one-stop shop to learn how to follow a set of best practices is a benefit to all VAs in the business world.

__My fun facts:__
* I love riding Harleys.
* I love hard rock music.
* I am a Sprint Car Sponsor.
