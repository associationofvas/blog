![Keisha Page]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/VAforaday-Keisha.png)

I help premium health and wellness businesses create captivating content so that they can reach their ideal customers, generate more revenue, and gain authority in their industry.

__Connect With Me:__
* Website: [workingmamamedia.com](https://www.workingmamamedia.com/){:target="_blank"}

__Why I recommend AVA:__
AVA has given me the opportunity to network with other VA's, to find training so that I can broaden my offerings, and view job opportunities.

__My fun facts:__
* I'm uncommonly graceful; I once fell UP a set of stairs!  
* I'm a published author.
* I will drink a cup of hot tea on a 90 degree day in August! I don't even care (although I love iced tea, too!).
