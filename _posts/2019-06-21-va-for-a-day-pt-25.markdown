Techie VA/Certified OBM combo with over 10 years of experience working in a variety of capacities. I love working on making technology work for others and making things more efficient.

__Connect With Me:__

__Why I recommend AVA:__
I think this group is filled with tons of information that can help you be successful in your venture. I also love the fact that everyone is so friendly and helpful when you have a question. It's just a close community online that I am happy to be apart of.

__My fun facts:__
* I started my VA journey on Elance (now upwork) in the early 2000's as a side hustle.
* I'm the owner of a 16 year old black kitty who makes her presence known on many a client call by howling and sitting well within camera view.
* Finally, my only claim to infamy - I met Jeffrey Dahmer before he was arrested (actually stood in the doorway to his apartment). :)
