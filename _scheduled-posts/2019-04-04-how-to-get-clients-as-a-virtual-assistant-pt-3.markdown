This  stage of how to get clients as a virtual assistant is also referred to as niching. In our last article we discussed what to do if you don’t feel you’re ready to niche yet.

Niching is one of the stages virtual assistants often resist the most. It can seem limiting and as if you are turning away clients when in fact it is just the opposite. Instead of turning away clients you are attracting clients toward you.

Niching attracts the right, high-value, ideal clients. It is NOT competition. You are not in competition with other virtual assistants or companies. In fact, your competition, if you choose to see it that way, is the client. Will the client believe you provide more value to their business than they do while providing the same duties?

There is a way to make niching fun so let’s do that! In the same way your favorite outfit or best hair day makes you feel special and ready to shine, so should your niche. Think about those high-value clients. Those clients who place a high value on your work as well. Why are they going to hire you?

___Pro tip: It’s not because they need you. High-value clients don’t just hire people, they throw money at problems. Think about the client who wants to throw money at you to solve their problem. Imagine a potential client speaking with you and when they hear what you can provide they throw their hands up in the air, yell “YES!”, throw money at you, and ask when you can get started. That is your niche.___

Don’t worry if this takes a little time. The process is not step-by-step or linear. In fact, when you leave yourself open to possibilities instead of chasing after the wrong clients your ideal clients will often find you.

___Pro tip: If you are asked by two separate people to do the same task that you feel unqualified to do, DO IT! We often can’t see the potential in ourselves that others do. It means you are attracting your ideal clients.___

If you are coming from administrative or executive assistance into virtual assistance there can be feelings of not doing enough and like you are short changing the client because you are used to being the “all the things EA”. When you become a VA you don’t want to be all the things, unless you still want to be chained to your laptop and on call all the time. Here are some actionable steps to take in order to find your niche:
Ask your friends and family to tell you what they would think your occupation is if they didn’t know you already.
Ask yourself what section of the library or bookstore you would hang out it all day if you could.
Ask your family, friends and colleagues if they were to hire a VA what would they pay top dollar for.
