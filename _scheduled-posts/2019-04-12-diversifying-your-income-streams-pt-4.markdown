In this article series we’ve discussed what diversifying your income streams is and why it’s important, ways to grow your business without leaving the industry and changing your title, and how to earn passive income. What often goes unspoken is that when you diversify your income streams you naturally not only earn more from the other sources, you also become more in demand which means you get to raise your rates confidently.

There is no denying that people love what is in demand. The restaurant that has a waitlist doesn’t deter the person wishing to spend several hundred dollars on dinner. It makes the person more anxious to be served pay! The new phone coming out in limited quantities doesn’t charge less. People are lined up around the corner to pay more! However, the big shift here is mindset.

How confident are you in raising your rates when you don’t have another source of income? How confident are you in getting more clients when you haven’t made a name for you or your business? How confident would you be if you had already proven to yourself that you can earn money in a variety of ways?

Raising your rates doesn’t always price out your long-term faithful clients either. You can either grandfather their pricing in or you can create tiered pricing around them. The point is, now you have more options when choosing what type of rates, tiered pricing, packages, or bundles you want to offer. You’ll need to rethink this too as it is a certainty that your lifestyle will have changed.

You may have started your business with one goal in mind - make enough money to replace your old income. However, when your income goals are fulfilled there are new goals and challenges you’ll naturally set for yourself. These are exciting times!
