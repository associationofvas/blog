Chances are, you are thinking about new clients as you grow. Or you might be thinking about the clients you currently have and want to retain. If you are going to grow the right way you’ll need to think about current clients, the clients you’ll gain, and the clients you’ll not be able to support any longer. You shouldn’t think of any of these bad but they don’t call it growing pains for nothing.

When thinking about new clients feedback is crucial. Ask your potential clients what is valuable to them. Not just in terms of pricing but the verbiage. What you think is a given or an obvious assumption to what is included in your services may not be obvious to clients. It’s never just about what you offer but how you offer it. What are the words that keep coming back when asking for feedback? What are the feelings and emotions expressed? Capture these and you will capture the attention of those you most want to attract as new clients.

Clients you are currently supporting will need to be notified of your new services, packages, and pricing as well. The key to having these clients grow with you is to include them in the process. You could offer a webinar, a fun video script, or even a nice infographic to explain how you’re growing and how they can be a part of it.

Don’t hesitate to ask for their feedback as well. Your clients most likely want to be a part of the growth but will need you to clarify how they fit in. Give them the opportunity to support you and help you spread the word.

In the event you are discontinuing services and anticipate letting go of some of your clients, having an offboarding plan is key. You never want to burn bridges. Clients will thank you and continue to refer you if you serve them even in offboarding. It’s also a good practice to thank them for being a part of your company growth.
