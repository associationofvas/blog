Why I recommend AVA: AVA provides educational resources, supportive community, and professional growth opportunities

Fun Facts About Me: 1. I love slacklining. It's my type of meditation. 2. My best way to unwind after a busy day is to cook a delicious dinner for my family. 3. I'm a big tea drinker and love making various herbal tea mixes that I share with my family and friends.
