As the founder of Darlene Walker VA, LLC, I'm passionate about treating each client as my only client and dedicated to their business as if it were my own.

When Iâ€™m not in my office, you can find me at the beach or the soccer field, dreaming of the beach!

__Why I recommend AVA:__
AVA is a place where virtual assistants can learn, grow, and help develop industry standards together.

__My fun facts:__
* I sing when driving (often), dance (even when people are looking).
* I met my husband of 26 years while running roller coasters at Cedar Point Amusement Park.
