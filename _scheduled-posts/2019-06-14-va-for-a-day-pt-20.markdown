I am a professional VA specializing in small business, executive and entrepreneur support. I have 20+ years supporting private and non-profit groups and I recently started to build L-12 Services, my VA & Business Consulting brand. I speak and advocate for eating disorders and weight stigma prevention and I live in Washington DC with my husband and 2 beautiful girl dogs, Pumpkin and Tigger.

__Connect With Me:__
* LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/lizabeth-wesely-casell](www.linkedin.com/in/lizabeth-wesely-casella){:target="_blank"}

__Why I recommend AVA:__
It is a fast paced, highly interactive community with active and knowledgeable members.  In my short time as a member I've frequently interacted with both colleagues and the AVA leadership and each occasion I have left with a new piece of information and perspective.  In addition, the increasing amount of resource material is very valuable and current which is so helpful with the ever-changing landscape of VA branding, pricing, and marketing.

__My fun facts:__
* I briefly hosted (produced if you could call it that) a cooking show on YouTube.  
* I built an information and advocacy website for eating disorders and weight stigma prevention which, within 1 year of development, enabled me to consult on language edits to the Let's Move! program by the Office of the First Lady.  
* I moved from Arizona to Washington DC and married my next door neighbor.
