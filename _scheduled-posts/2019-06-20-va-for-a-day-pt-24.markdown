![Jamie Feinberg]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/VAforaday-Jamie.png)

An experienced administrator, educator and performing artist, Iâ€™ve worked as a leader in arts administration, performance and education.  

__Connect With Me:__
* LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/jamiefeinberg](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiefeinberg/){:target="_blank"}

__Why I recommend AVA:__
AVA is a wonderful group of extremely supportive VA's. There's always someone there with an answer to a question or help to solve a problem.

__My fun facts:__
* I'm a full-time RVer, traveling the U.S. in a 25 ft RV with my husband and a cat. I am also obsessed with ice cream!
So my two travel blogs, appropriately, are RossAndJamieAdventure.com and InSearchOfAScoop.com
