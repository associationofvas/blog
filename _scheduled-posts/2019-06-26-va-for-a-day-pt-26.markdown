I’m supporting online business owners with a big vision to shift their business from struggle, overwhelm and inefficiency to a structured wholistic business with all systems and processes in place to run smoothly. By giving them the individual strategies, implementation service and support structures needed to have peace of mind with their (daily) business operations my clients are able to concentrate on growing and making an impact on the world.

__Why I recommend AVA:__
Within the AVA I can connect with VAs from all around the world and find valuable knowledge and skills in areas outside of my own expertise. That gives me the opportunity to collaborate with others and offer my clients additional services as needed.

__My fun facts:__
* I’m an avid reader and savour about one book per week. My favorite topics are books about business education, transformational work and self-development and fantasy novels.
* My biggest passion is to travel the world and explore incredible places and experiences regularly. I love to meet new people, explore different ways of living and dive into the unique culture and community of each region.
* I’m keeping a journal called Life Book for all the different areas in my life, where I’m constantly defining the way I want to live my life and the goals I want to achieve in each category. It’s an ongoing work that keeps me in touch with my deepest desires and helps me to maintain an up-to-date bucket list with all of my lifetime goals.
