Summer has a natural way of changing how we run our virtual assistant business. However, as VAs we are natural planners so it’s no surprise that many of us will be planning and fine tuning for the last quarter of the year a few months ahead of time.

Of course, one of the most in demand qualities of any kind of virtual assistant is to be able to anticipate the needs of your clients. In order to do this I always start with the calendar then by reviewing the current roadmap, and finishing the quarter (and in this case) the year strong.

It’s hard to believe that the end of the year is so close, but it is. I like to give my business a little relaunch this time of year. Why wait until January to unveil or try something new? I’ll cover how I like to relaunch in the second part of this blog series.

__Calendar Updates__

The last quarter of the year is quite busy. There’s a time change in the States, many birthdays that I celebrate, holidays which are not all the same for me and my clients, plenty of travel, and it’s also a time of year when it’s common for people to get sick. I do my best to plan for all these things on my calendar and my client’s calendar.

First, I look at my set meetings and determine if those times are still going to be the best moving forward. Then I go through the calendar with my clients and we look at their schedule for both work and personal to make sure we are forecasting their time appropriately. There is no need to be caught off guard by what we already know is coming up. Lastly, I buffer in extra time and/or downtime. It’s not a question of if I or my client’s or going to need it. Rather it’s a question of when. Moving the scheduled time around is easy. Creating the time after the fact is much more difficult.

* Do you have set meetings through the end of the year planned?
* Should they be changed for time, day, or week?
* Have you taken into account board meetings, holiday parties, end of year launches and even athletic and art practices and recitals?
* You’ll pat yourself on the back for getting it all done now.
* Your clients will wonder how they could ever live without you and be thankful they don’t have to!

__Reviewing the Current Roadmap__

It’s inevitable that changes in you or your client’s roadmap occur. This is the perfect time to reprioritize the roadmap if needed. I find that during the summer months I will have read several books while traveling or on vacation. Naturally, I have new ideas and may want to implement a new process or system. It’s a common practice for client’s too.

You may find it’s time to another a new strategy session. Or you may learn you and your client are right on track with where you want to be on the roadmap. However, you’ll never know if you don’t take time to review it.

* Is it time for you to hire a VA of your own to help you implement new products and/or services for your business?
* Don’t wait for your clients to prompt you and have unrealistic deadlines for the work they want to accomplish.
* Remember that the clients with a booming business don’t necessarily think of closing down their business just because it’s a busy last quarter of the year. They are counting on you to automate their business so they take off while their business is still running strong.
* The best VAs can be booked well in advance during the last quarter of the year. Get a VA in place now not only for planned assistance, but for emergency assistance as well. Emergencies don’t make appointments and you need to plan for your business just as much for your client’s.

__Finish the Quarter (Year) Strong__

Knowing how I’m going to hit my goals and work with clients to hit their goals by the end of the quarter/year is imperative. In my VA matchmaking business the last quarter and the first quarter of the year are the busiest. However, the last two years I was also writing books in the last quarter of the year and releasing them in the first quarter of the new year. I was only able to do it because I had a lot of assistance!

You might find yourself on the opposite side of the spectrum and wish to take off the month of December or the first few weeks in January. Finishing strong also means that you are setting yourself up to launch again.

Whether you are launching, releasing, or taking a break know how you’re going to get back into the game. This includes your finances. Don’t be caught off guard and likewise don’t let your client’s be either.

With all you are taking into account don’t forget the emotions and stress of it all. Your best client is a person too and life happens to us all. No matter how much you plan in advance, plan to adapt and pivot when needed.


Getting back to your virtual assistant business should start by assessing the situation, then taking anticipatory steps and planning.
