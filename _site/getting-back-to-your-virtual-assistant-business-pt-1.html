      <p>In this month’s blog series, Association of Virtual Assistants member Lee Edralinda of <a href="http://virtualee.co/" target="_blank">Virtualee</a> shares her expertise on getting back to your virtual assistant business.</p>

<p>When you’re running a virtual assistant business during the summer, you can’t help but get disrupted. Attending outings with family and friends because you want to catch up with everyone while they’re on vacation, out of town trips to make the most out of the season, and for those with school age kids, summer means that they are on school break. You’ll naturally want to spend more time with them since they are at home.</p>

<p>However, when you’re running a business, you can’t just set it aside completely while you are on vacation. For us virtual assistant business owners, we need to keep it running despite the downtime. There has to be a contingency plan in place so that it will be easier for you to get back on track after the summer.</p>

<p>I try to keep a balance between work and life. While I am enjoying the summer with the people I care for and taking care of my little one too, I make sure that there is a thing or two that I do for my business amidst the season. Thinking ahead last summer, I took a masterclass course called Lead your Business like a CEO.</p>

<p>As virtual assistant business owners, we tend to overdo our ideas and plans. In doing so, the execution can sometimes be challenging, especially when we inevitably get disrupted. Here are some of the key points that I’ve learned and how I plan to implement it in relaunching my online business for the last quarter of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Mindset</strong></p>

<p>Owning a virtual assistant business doesn’t mean that your mindset is of a CEO’s right on the onset. Many of us struggle from switching from an employee mindset to a CEO mindset. To understand this, you need to be able to identify the difference between the two. The employee mindset is all about the present. It focuses on tasks and projects that are already on hand. This is the mindset that you need to use when you’re doing your day-to-day tasks. But you should not let this mindset to be the driver of your business, or you might just end up with a lot of short-term plans without any going forward directions.</p>

<p>A CEO mindset focuses on the bigger picture and thinks outside the box. You are the captain of the ship, which means that you have a clear itinerary of where your business is heading. A CEO mindset doesn’t get distracted with the multiple things that you do every single day. Instead, you find time to look at the long-term direction of your business. In a nutshell, a CEO mindset is all about building a pathway, and a direction for your business. It’s all about planning, and that is why many CEOs use 90-day goal planning.</p>

<p>In next week’s blog, I’ll cover the 90-day goal planning which includes prioritization, as well as systems and planning.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong>
Trust me, the ride to start thinking as a CEO passes through a bumpy road. It’s doesn’t happen instantly but, the best way to start working on it is when you are relaunching your business after a vacation because your mind and body have recuperated enough. Once you start thinking like a CEO, I can almost guarantee that your virtual assistant business will head to the right direction. Remember, CEOs think, plan, and execute!</p>
