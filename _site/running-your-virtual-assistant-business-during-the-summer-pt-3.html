      <p>Running Your Virtual Assistant Business During the Summer: Disconnecting and Taking Your Own Vacation as a VA</p>

<p>We all need to disconnect and get away from our businesses no matter how much we love them. Vacation not only gives you the opportunity to miss and get creative in your work, it can give your clients the opportunity to miss you too.</p>

<p>For those of us who plan vacations this is time to put as much time into our own as the vacations of our clients.</p>

<p>Not all vacations go as planned and there are certainly challenges that can come up. This week we’re going to be hearing from our four founding AVA members about their vacation planning.</p>

<p><strong>Disconnecting On Vacation</strong></p>

<p>Only one of the VAs we interviewed, Heather Nitch of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/heathernitchdoitthewriteway/" target="_blank">Do It the Write Way</a>, says she never works on vacation.</p>

<p>Work doesn’t always have to be about clients. Katie Ehle of <a href="https://www.ekklesiamarketing.com" target="_blank">Ekklesia Marketing</a> uses this time for her own business. “I work during the kids nap time and nights. Usually I don’t do client work during vacations but I will catch up on my business stuff (bookkeeping, blogging, social media/content schedule etc.).”</p>

<p>Alicia Peterkin of <a href="https://newmethodsconsulting.com/" target="_blank">New Methods Consulting</a> makes it a point to check-in online but knows how to prioritize. “If there is a pressing project going on for a client, I make it a point to check my emails at the end of my day with my family.  So they are in bed or watching tv by that point.  Anything that is important gets dealt with, anything not important gets left until I am officially back in the office.”</p>

<p>Disconnecting can be challenging, but Keisha Page <a href="http://www.workingmamamedia.com" target="_blank">Working Mama Media</a> uses the morning not to take away from family time. “I usually wake up early to check mail and handle any issues BEFORE the rest of the family is up. I’ll check in once or twice more during the day.”</p>

<p><strong>Vacation Systems In Place</strong></p>

<p>With Heather not working on vacation it’s no surprise she’s got an excellent system in place. “I give a month’s notice. I do schedule my emails ahead and if something does come up last minute, I will either have a VA on call or tend to emergency circumstances.”</p>

<p>Katie makes sure that from the very beginning her clients know about scheduled vacation time. “My vacation is planned a year in advance so I always work it into my contract if I have clients during that time. I try to automate as much as possible.”</p>

<p>Open communication is the key to Alicia’s success and ability to truly enjoy her vacation time. “I give them notice of about a month just in case they’d like to do things differently when I am out.  We have a discussion about our plan while I’m out and then I am free to enjoy worry free and they are not panicked with my being out.”</p>

<p><strong>When Things Don’t Go As Planned</strong></p>

<p>Virtual assistants are no doubt some of the best planners. Yet, not even we can predict the future. So what happens when you take a vacation and things don’t go as planned?</p>

<p>For Katie, vacations are such a high priority that it won’t stop her from taking a vacation. “No, I only get/take one vacation a year so it is non-negotiable and therefore the terms are laid in my contracts for clients that I may have during that time.”</p>

<p>Don’t allow the fear of emergencies stop you from taking vacation. Heather and Alicia find they are pretty rare.</p>

<p>Heather - “I have only had one emergency situation arise and I was able to manage it. So, my vacations have been successful. I would advise other VAs to set boundaries, communicate how you are accommodating needs while you are away and prepare as much as possible.”</p>

<p>Alicia - “Once and that was because of the type of client I had.  They didn’t respect boundaries and although we had agreed on a plan of me checking emails at the end of each night and also that I could be texted or called in an emergency, they were calling and texting about every little thing.  My advice would be stand your ground - we give a lot of ourselves to our clients so we NEED that time and we need to set the parameters.  It was at this point that I asked a team member to be the point of contact in instances where I’d really like to tune out.”</p>
